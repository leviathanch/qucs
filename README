Description
===========

Qucs is a graphical user interface for circuit simulation and related tasks
(c) Stefan Jahn 2003, 2005, 2011, GPLv2+, see AUTHORS. This modified,
community maintained version is developped and distributed under GPL3+.

The current work in progress coordinated by Gnucap developpers adds
standardisation and interoperability with other tools. The Gnucap project is
funded through the NGI0 Entrust Fund, a fund established by NLnet with
financial support from the European Commission's Next Generation Internet
programme, under the aegis of DG Communications Networks, Content and
Technology under grant agreement No 101069594.

History

Old homepage: https://qucs.sourceforge.net

Requirements
============

Qucs needs Qt version 5 or later. For simplicity, the Qt configuration is
currently obtained through pkg-config, which you need to install in addition
to Qt.

Qt packages have strange names. Try these for Qt5/6 respectively

# apt install qtbase5-dev qttools5-dev libqt5svg5-dev
# apt install qt6-base-dev qt6-svg-dev

Development
===========

Qucs source code is stored in a git repo. Two build systems are included.
The traditional autotools build system needs to be created by developpers,
when not using a tarball. Run ./bootstrap after cloning. The CMake build
system does not require this step. Choose your pick.

Installation
============

Unpack the distribution tarball:

    $ tar xvzf qucs-<version>.tar.gz               (using GNU tar)
    $ gzip -cd qucs-<version>.tar.gz | tar xvf -   (using another tar)

Change into the source directory:

    $ cd qucs-<version>

Configure the source package for your system,

    $ ./configure

Configure the source package, but use Qt6

    $ ./configure --with-qt-name=Qt6

Now compile the package:

    $ make

Qt6 wants a newer standard, use the following.

    $ make CXXFLAGS=-std=c++17

Install Qucs:

    $ make install

You must have root privileges if you want to install the package in the
standard location (/usr/local) or in any location that is only writable
by root.

For further information on installing the package, please consult the
file INSTALL included in this distribution.

Please note:  Users of the FreeBSD OS may use a GNU make (probably gmake)
to compile and install the package.

Getting the latest Git snapshot
===============================

You can always get the latest Qucs version from our Git repository.
Please use an official release if you want to work with Qucs.  The Git
version might not even compile.

    $ git clone http://git.code.sf.net/p/qucs/git qucs-git

Press 'Enter' when asked for a password.  Run `sh bootstrap' and `configure'
(see above) with the appropriate options.  Maintainance currently requires
Autoconf version 2.57 and GNU automake 1.7.0.
