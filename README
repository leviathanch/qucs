Description
===========

Qucs is a graphical user interface for circuit simulation and related tasks.
The software aims to support all kinds of circuits. This is a work in
progress.

Old homepage: https://qucs.sourceforge.net


Requirements
============

Qucs needs Qt version 5 or later. For simplicity, the Qt configuration is
currently obtained through pkg-config, which you need to install in addition
to Qt.

Qt packages have strange names. Try these for Qt5/6 respectively

# apt install qtbase5-dev qttools5-dev libqt5svg5-dev
# apt install qt6-base-dev qt6-svg-dev

Development
===========

Qucs source code is stored in a git repo. Two build systems are included.
The traditional autotools build system needs to be created by developpers,
when not using a tarball. Run ./bootstrap after cloning. The CMake build
system does not require this step. Choose your pick.

Contribute
==========

See CONTRIBUTE.

Installation
============

Unpack the distribution tarball:

    $ tar xvzf qucs-<version>.tar.gz               (using GNU tar)
    $ gzip -cd qucs-<version>.tar.gz | tar xvf -   (using another tar)

Change into the source directory:

    $ cd qucs-<version>

Configure the source package for your system,

    $ ./configure

Configure the source package, but use Qt6

    $ ./configure --with-qt-name=Qt6

Now compile the package:

    $ make

Qt6 wants a newer standard, use the following.

    $ make CXXFLAGS=-std=c++17

Install Qucs:

    $ make install

You must have root privileges if you want to install the package in the
standard location (/usr/local) or in any location that is only writable
by root.

For further information on installing the package, please consult the
file INSTALL included in this distribution.

Please note:  Users of the FreeBSD OS may use a GNU make (probably gmake)
to compile and install the package.

Getting the latest Git snapshot
===============================

You can always get the latest Qucs version from our Git repository.
Please use an official release if you want to work with Qucs.  The Git
version might not even compile.

    $ git clone http://git.code.sf.net/p/qucs/git qucs-git

Press 'Enter' when asked for a password.  Run `sh bootstrap' and `configure'
(see above) with the appropriate options.  Maintainance currently requires
Autoconf version 2.57 and GNU automake 1.7.0.
