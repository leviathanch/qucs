== Various types of tests

- programs. compiled and linked against libqucs. return value (exit code)
  determines success.
- "sh". shell scripts, similar but no need to compile.
- "prj" -- projects. create netlists from various schematics,
  compare against reference.
- "qx", qucs scripts. cli end-to-end tests.

== Keeping track of test status

(Borrowed from Gnucap) A test hook ('{' in a suitable context) that is not
reached by the tests is followed by "untested();" or "itested();". This
indicates that the tests are incomplete and need work (Please provide tests if
you feel that an untested call is unjustified). An "itested();" call indicates
that the hook has been reached during an interactive testing session. A normal
debug build (--enable-debug) will report "untested();" hooks for better
debugging. To see or refresh the other ones, pass -DTRACE_ITESTED to the
preprocesor.
