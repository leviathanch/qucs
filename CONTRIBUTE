Thanks for wanting to contribute to Qucs.

Qucs is a monolithic Qt application that requires some refactoring. We still
accept patches that fix bugs or clean up the data. Patches will be merged as
soon as they pass review.

There is no official review process (yet), and we are looking for a maintainer.
So, we might be slow, but will try not to reject useful patches.

Anyway, check your contribution against the following criteria to streamline
the review merge process. Also make sure that you have the permission to submit
your contribution under GPLv3-or-later.

- Explain the intent of a change. Apply 50/72 rule or so.
- Avoid huge patches. Review time is >quadratic in patch size.
- Run the tests, add more that cover the code you are changing.
- Synchronise tests with each commit, so they pass.
- Do not change white space. Yes, it's a mess. Diff noise is worse.
- Do not reformat obsolete code. Mark it obsolete with a comment.

Consider our ROADMAP for long term plans. At the time of writing we are working
on data exchange. Your contribution to Qucs might as well be an independent
project supporting the file format.
